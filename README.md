# CleaningDataProject

Author: Jay Anderson
Purpose: Class project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera.

Function: The run_analysis.R script will download the data, unzip it, and then output two files:
- cleaned_merged_data.txt -- A cleansed data set based on the original data
- tidy_set.txt -- A summarized data set based on the participants and activities

Assignement Objectives:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
